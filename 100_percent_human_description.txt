modern music players these days are centered around streaming services and web UI interfaces that hog ram and CPU usage. TuneTUI aims to provide a solution to this. It is a local music player Text User Interface (TUI) that runs in the command line by typing `tune` after installation, or by just running the portable tune.exe

the main features of tuneTUI include:

library tab with dynamic queue system, adding individual folders and a magnitude of ways to arrange a song queue, such as playlists, playing just a directory, or playing from a queue of all songs. There is shuffling and looping mode support and configs for crossfade, song scrub length, loudness normalization, audio device, and theme. 

stats tab with realtime listening statistics by listening time and play count. view live graphs and charts of your playtime and filter and sort it a variety of ways such as timeframe, artist, album, and song name. 

lyrics tab for line by line lyrics as the song plays, aswell as support for live metadata editing including the lyrics and song data. 

Online tab for listening to songs with your friends where you establish a p2p connection and can add to a shared queue and control playback together or have one user control and just playing their music while another listens along. 

todo:

live graph updates
song listening data is lost if program is executed - we need to save it periodically as you listen,
that way the live graph updates is fixed too
